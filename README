# ðŸš€ Journey of Learning Modern C++

This project documents my hands-on journey of preparing for C++ interviews by mastering **modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)** concepts such as:

- [x] RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- [] Smart Pointers: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`
- [] Rule of 3 and Rule of 5
- [] Thread-safe programming with `std::mutex` and `std::thread`
- [] Manual implementation of resource-safe classes
- [] Deep dive into STL containers and algorithms
